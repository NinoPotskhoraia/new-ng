This is my most recent Angular project. It implements RxJS Subjects, Firebase Authentication, Firestore database and a number of Angular features. The UI is built with bootstrap and is fully responsive.
Two main parts of the project are To Do List module and Profile Page.
The user can sign up, log in then create a to do list, mark tasks as completed, update tasks even after marking them completed and delete the task from the list at any point.
The list is available on Profile page. Also the profile page desplays User's name that they specify during sign up process.
The contents of to do list is kept after user refreshes page or logs out and is retrieved when the user logs in again.
The project is built with feature based architecture and container-presentation model in mind.
